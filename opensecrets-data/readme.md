The bulk data provided by OpenSecrets.org is divided into 4 subject groups: Campaign finance Data, Lobbying Data, 527 Data, and Personal Finance Data. The connections provided by each data set are listed below.


Campaign Finance Data Sets
==========================

Background: The FEC is the government body responsible for policing campaign finance laws. Only individuals and PACs are allowed to donate to political campaigns. (Note: a Supreme Court decision in September 2009 changed this). PACs are private groups that exist to influence elections and legislation. They are allowed to donate the money they raise directly to candidates. Individuals cannot donate more than $5000 to a PAC. Business are not allowed to donate any money to a PAC, but they may sponsor a PAC and pay its administrative costs.
